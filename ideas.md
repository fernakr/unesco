# To Do
- Come up with the compulsions
- Figure out what the conscious vs conscious layer


# Concept 
- Three layers: IRL, Conscious, Subconscious
    - IRL: Animation showing what it looks like on outside / what is visible to others / anything said out loud
    - Conscious: Inner thoughts?
    - Subconscious: The code behind the scenes
- Types of Compulsions
    - Skin / scab picking
    - Haircutting
    - Elbow tapping
    

# Considerations
- Is this just an immersive experience or is it interactive?
- Perhaps a way for people to switch between compulsions
- Or maybe a mini-game concept where trying to control the compulsion
- Is it compulsive vs impulsive


# Definitions
- Impulsive behavior is a spontaneous, thoughtless action taken for immediate gratification, while compulsive behavior is a repetitive, ritualistic act performed to reduce anxiety or prevent a feared outcome
